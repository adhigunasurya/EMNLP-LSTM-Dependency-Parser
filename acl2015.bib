    The temporal distance between events conveys information essential for
    numerous sequential tasks such as motor control and rhythm detection.
    While Hidden Markov Models tend to ignore this information, recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) can in principle learn to make use of it.  We focus
    on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) because it has been shown to outperform
    other RNNs on tasks involving long time lags.  We find that LSTM augmented
    by "peephole connections" from its internal cells to its multiplicative
    gates can learn the fine distinction between sequences of spikes spaced
    either 50 or 49 time steps apart without the help of any short training
    exemplars.  Without external resets or teacher forcing, our LSTM variant
    also learns to generate stable streams of precisely timed spikes and other
    highly nonlinear periodic patterns.  This makes LSTM a promising approach
    for tasks that require the accurate measurement or generation of time
    intervals.

The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}
